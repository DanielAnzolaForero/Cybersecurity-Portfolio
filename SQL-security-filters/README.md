# SQL Security Investigation: Filtering Techniques for Cybersecurity Operations

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SQL filtering techniques to support cybersecurity investigations in a simulated corporate environment.  
The scenario focuses on analyzing authentication logs, identifying suspicious activity, and preparing targeted security updates for employee systems.

The objective of this project is to showcase the ability to extract precise, security-relevant data using SQL operators such as **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, and **LIKE** across operational datasets.

A detailed PDF report containing the full analysis is available in the `/docs` directory.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Log analysis using SQL  
- Identification of suspicious authentication patterns  
- Data filtering and investigative querying  
- Understanding of role-based access and department-level segmentation  
- Application of SQL logic in cybersecurity workflows  
- Use of `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` for threat investigation

## Dataset Used

The analysis uses two simulated tables:

- **log_in_attempts**: Contains timestamps, success/failure data, and country codes for login events.
- **employees**: Includes department and office location details for security update planning.

## Summary

- This project demonstrates how SQL filtering helps isolate suspicious login activity, support security investigations, and organize targeted security updates for employee devices. Logical operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and LIKE were applied to extract relevant records efficiently.
