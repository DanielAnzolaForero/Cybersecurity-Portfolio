# Botium Toys – Audit Context and Problem Overview

## 1. Audit Scope and Purpose
Botium Toys requested an internal audit of its entire cybersecurity program.  
The objective is to compare current practices against industry standards and identify high-risk vulnerabilities.  
The audit team is expected to document findings, propose remediation actions, and communicate results to stakeholders.  
All systems, assets, internal processes, and security procedures fall within the scope of this assessment.

The audit focuses on reviewing:
- User permissions across accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection, and SIEM tools  
- Technical and administrative controls implemented in these systems  
- Operational procedures and response protocols  
- Alignment with relevant compliance requirements  
- Asset inventory accuracy for hardware, software, and system access

## 2. Audit Goals
The IT manager has defined several objectives for the audit:
- Align the organization with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)  
- Strengthen compliance processes and technology governance  
- Improve system controls and enforce least-privilege access  
- Formalize policies, procedures, and operational playbooks  
- Provide justification for hiring additional cybersecurity personnel  
- Deliver a clear evaluation of the current security posture and recommendations for improvement

## 3. Current Assets
The IT Department manages a wide variety of assets, including:
- On-premises devices and equipment supporting in-office operations  
- Employee hardware: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, peripherals, and various accessories  
- Core business systems: accounting, telecommunications, databases, security platforms, e-commerce, and inventory systems  
- Network infrastructure and internet services  
- Vendor access controls and data center hosting  
- Data storage and retention solutions  
- Physical access systems such as badge readers  
- Legacy systems requiring manual oversight

## 4. Risk Description
Botium Toys currently lacks effective asset management and does not have the necessary controls to meet U.S. and international compliance standards.  
This increases the likelihood of regulatory penalties and operational disruptions.

## 5. Risk Score
**Risk Level: 8/10 (High)**  
The high score reflects missing security controls, weak governance, and incomplete compliance practices.

## 6. Additional Notes
The lack of structured asset tracking and insufficient adherence to required data-protection standards significantly raises operational and regulatory risks.  
Improving visibility, policies, and control implementation is essential for strengthening Botium Toys’ security posture.
